# AI Agent Conversational Improvements - Summary

## What Was Fixed

### ✓ Removed the "?" Symbol from Responses
- **Before:** `❓ I didn't understand your request. Could you clarify what you want to do with the cursor or keyboard.`
- **After:** `I'm not sure where you want me to move the cursor. Could you specify a location like 'center', 'top left', or specific coordinates?`

### ✓ Fixed "Type Hello" Problem
The most critical fix! Previously, saying "type hello world" would trigger a greeting response instead of typing the text.

- **Before:** 
  - User: "type hello world"
  - AI: "Hello! I'm ready to help..." (WRONG - should type the text!)

- **After:**
  - User: "type hello world"  
  - AI: "Done! I've typed 'hello world'" (CORRECT!)

### ✓ Natural Conversational Responses
The AI now responds naturally to all inputs:

**Greetings:**
- User: "hello"
- AI: "Hello! I'm ready to help you control your cursor and keyboard. What would you like me to do?"

**Commands:**
- User: "move cursor to center"
- AI: "Done! I've moved the cursor moved to center at (960, 540)"

**Gratitude:**
- User: "thanks"
- AI: "You're welcome! Let me know if you need anything else."

**Help:**
- User: "what can you do"
- AI: "I can help you move the cursor, click, type text, scroll, and press keys. Just tell me what you'd like!"

## Example Conversation Flow

```
User: hello
AI: Hello! I'm ready to help you control your cursor and keyboard. What would you like me to do?

User: move cursor to center
AI: Done! I've moved the cursor moved to center at (960, 540)

User: click
AI: Got it! I've performed a left click.

User: type hello world
AI: Done! I've typed 'hello world'
